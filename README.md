Knowledge Base project on Means of Transportation for Knowledge Systems course.

This project implements a semantic knowledge base regarding Means of Transportation, like buses, trains, ships and airplanes. The project consists of 3 parts.

  Ontology for knowledge base was created in Protege. Class, Object property and Data property hierarchies can be seen below.
  
  

### 2. Trasnforming data to RDF triples

  We transformed ttl data to RDF triples in Turtle format using Apache Jena Framework.

### 3. Querying data with Sparql
